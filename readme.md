## 👋 About Me

I’m a **Computer Science student & AI-focused builder** who enjoys turning ideas into working products.

I learn by **building real systems**, breaking them, fixing them, and improving them again.  
My work spans **AI applications, full-stack development, and intelligent interfaces** — always with a focus on clarity, performance, and real-world use.

Currently exploring how **voice, reasoning, and visual intelligence** can work together inside modern AI products.
